Now you'll know where you'll be deploying next.
## Community Quests
1. Find where  [Gorodok](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Gorodok)  is located.

	I suspect [here](https://goo.gl/maps/ojkUekJN93qsDR4L7). [  
	Here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/squad_maps/gorodok_quest.png)  is the reason.

2. Find exact location of Mutaha.

	Mutaha is  [SAID](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Mutaha)  to be located in a contested area near Syria-Iraq border. I marked the most probable location. See if you can find a better match.

3. Find locations of  [BELAYA](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Belaya)  and  [FOOL'S ROAD](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Fool%27s_Road)  (might not exist irl).

## Contribute
The code is a bit messy, I admit. But please, feel free to contribute. 

I left my API key for Mapbox in the code, I'd appreciate if you did not exploit that somehow. You should get your own API key if developing or (re)publishing. 

Adaptation to 3D maps would be very appreciated, but some publicly available solutions (i.e. other than Mapbox) have quite low-res satellite raster tiles in most of the maps (especially Middle East and Southern Asia).
